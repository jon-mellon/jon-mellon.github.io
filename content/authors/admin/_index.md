I am an Assistant Professor at West Pointâ€™s Department of Systems Engineering and co-director of the British Election Study.

My research focuses on improving measurement and causal inference in social science. Substantively I study electoral behavior, online citizen engagement, and measuring public opinion. 

I have published 26 articles in peer reviewed journals including the *American Political Science Review*, *American Journal of Political Science*, and the *Journal of Politics*. I also co-authored *Electoral Shocks: The Volatile Voter in a Turbulent World* with Oxford University Press (available [open access](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/47106/9780198800583.pdf?sequence=1)). 

My full list of publications are available on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EekbrtcAAAAJ&hl=en) or my [CV](uploads/resume.pdf).
