# jon-mellon.github.io

This is the repository underlying my academic webpage. Getting this working on github pages took a lot more effort than I expected. If you want to get it to work, building from the build.R file in this repository is a big help as it copies the /public folder to /docs, which github will allow you to serve content from.
